# PowerShellPomodoro
A Very basic PowerShell Pomodoro timer, timer functionality was copied from https://github.com/StaleHansen/Public/tree/master/Start-SimplePomodoro

This script doesn't attempt to hide distractions, it's purely for initiating focus sessions and breaks.

The script tracks and displays the overall time focused after each session.
